  <Text>
    I donâ€™t just create software ~ I build projects that are resilient,
    scalable, and designed to run smoothly without compromise.
    <br />
    <br />
    I write code to the best of my ability, and when I discover a better
    approach, I embrace it and improve.
    <br />
    <br />
    Currently, I lead Better Bedrock, a platform used by hundreds of thousands
    to create, share, and download game content.
    <br />
    <br />
    My focus is always on delivering software that not only works today, but
    continues to scale and support users tomorrow.
